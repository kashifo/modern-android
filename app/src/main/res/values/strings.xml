    <string name="hello_again">I, Kashif have not lost my Android career, \nApp career not at all because I am in decent form in Flutter. \n\nI just didn\'t like the short-lasting culture of Google\'s Android Team, the android development ecosystem has got more unstable, fragmented and unorganized because of them, \n\n They are not doing well thought changes and having built-to-last principles, \n\n but rather they are always seem to be making changes without much thinking and later they themselves deprecate and change whole approach.</string>
